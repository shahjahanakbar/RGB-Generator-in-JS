# Random Color Generator

This is a simple web application that generates a random color when the user clicks a button. The generated color is displayed both as text and as the background color of a box.

## Usage

To use the Random Color Generator, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click the "Generate Color" button.
3. The text above the button will display the randomly generated color, and the background color of the box below will change accordingly.

## How it Works

The Random Color Generator uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to function. Here's a brief overview:

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styles the elements of the page, such as buttons, text, and boxes.
- **JavaScript**: Generates a random color when the button is clicked and updates the display accordingly.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: Defines the styles for the elements of the page.
- `app.js`: Contains the JavaScript code to generate random colors and handle button clicks.
